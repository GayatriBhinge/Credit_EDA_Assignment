# Excel Project | Youtube Views Forecast Data with Graphs

This project is to analyze the youtube channel viewers database. Here I forcast data for next 7 days with help of the Excel skill, also try to provide  more accurate forecasting using R square value and different graphs, like, Line, Polynomial, exponential graph.

# Graphs

## Line Graph
Here R² = 0.0.686, this value is more that 0.5 but do not have much confidance about forecast with this line graph.

## Exponentail Graph
Here R² = 0.563, not much confidnace about forecast with this Expontail graph

## Polynomial Graph
Here R² = 0.782, this value is near to 1 so having 85% confidance about forecast with this polynomial graph.

# R² Values are important in Forecasting Data
What is R² ?
R-Squared (R² or the coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure in a regression model that determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable. In other words, r-squared shows how well the data fit the regression model (the goodness of fit). This values is always between 0 to 1.
